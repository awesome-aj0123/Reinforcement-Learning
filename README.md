# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository consists of many reinforcement learning projects (with both environments from the OpenAI gym and custom environments). In order to achieve/complete tasks, we use both regular Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning with neural nets (DQNs). 

The code for the Atari Breakout game is inspired from Jon Krohn's GitHub page: https://github.com/the-deep-learners/TensorFlow-LiveLessons
